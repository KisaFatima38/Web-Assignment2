This file specifies the styles for the dashboard and the chatbot front end interfaces. Key features include:
Layout: The layout is based on flexbox for the purpose of responsiveness, where the sidebar menu and the main content take equal amounts of the width.
Colors: A basic blue theme with #21505d sidebar color and #4589e1 for buttons and active state.
